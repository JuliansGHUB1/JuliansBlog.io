<title> Thinking About Confidence Intervals, Confidence Levels </title>
<p> I'm currently talking the google analytics cert, and in the process I encountered two terms - confidence
intervals and confidence levels. I decided to research these terms a bit further, and I'd like to talk about
what I learned. Before I get into the nitty gritty, lets just define some terms. A population is the whole set
of data your studying, so perhaps its the height of all the students at your school. A sample is a subset of the data -
so maybe you randomly picked 50 students off your schools roster, and measured their heights.
</p> 

<p>
Lets say you wanted to know the average height of all the men at your school - a population parameter.
This might be a bit hard to figure out - as you would have to measure the 15k men at your University. 
Instead, you sample 125 students, and take the average of their heights. You get an average of 5'10. However,
theres a problem - you derived your average height from a sample, and thus theres a degree of uncertainity that
5'10 is the average height of the whole population. This is because there are many individuals whos height was not
factored into the average calculation, so it could be the case that the average of the entire population is different
than the sample. In order to deal with this uncertanity we have confidence intervals and confidence levels. 
</p>

<p>
Confidence intervals can be thought of a buffer surrounding the sample estimate, and confidence levels can be thought
of as the certainity we have that the true population parameter lies within the buffer. To explain with an example,
perhaps our confidence interval is the range of heights 5'8-5'11 and our confidence level is 95% (i.e. we believe
with 95% certainity that the true population parameter lies between 5'8-5'11). 

Well, how do we go from a sample estimate to a confidence interval and a confidence level? First, you select your
confidence level - do you want to be 95% sure that the population parameter lies in the range? 99% sure? A key thing
to remember is that the greater you increase your confidence level, the wider the range of values will be.
